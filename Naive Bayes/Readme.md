1. In this project, I build a Gaussian Naïve Bayes Classifier model to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year. The model yields a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy which was found to be 0.8083.
2. The training-set accuracy score is 0.8067 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8083. These two values are quite comparable. So, there is no sign of overfitting.
3. I have compared the model accuracy score which is 0.8083 with null accuracy score which is 0.7582. So, we can conclude that our Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier model is doing a very good job in predicting the class labels.
